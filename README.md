# Single_Program_Installer
Lists all available installers from the directory to choose from
Great for setting up new computers with essential software

You will need to add your installers with the 'EXE' extension
Currently, there is no support for other extensions
I recommend using Microsoft Visual Studio Code for editing and running

Feel free to edit the code, add it to your projects, and turn it into a full exe file of its own for easier use
